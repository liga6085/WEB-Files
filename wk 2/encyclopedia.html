    <h3>Plot</h3>
    <p>The story follows a young gelfling, named Jen, and his journey to repair the Crystal of Truth.</p>
    <p>The movie opens with a flashback, recalling the shattering of the Crystal of Truth during a skirmish between the Skeksis and urRu. 1000 years later we find Jen playing music by a river, he then receives
       news that his mentor and parental figure, UrSu, is dying. When Jen rushes back, UrSu tells him of the Skeksis and the dark crystal, and how he must repair it in by the next Grand Conjunction, or the
       Skeksis will rule forever. He tells Jen to search for Aughra, and that she will help him. After Ursu fades into starlight, Jen sets off on his quest. Meanwhile, the emperor of the Skeksis has passed
       and the remaining Skesis are plotting who the next leader will be. SkekSil, the chamberlain, steps forward to take the throne, however; SkekUng, the general, challenges him to a trial by stone. After
       the trial, the general being the victor, has the chamberlain stripped of his position, banishing him from the castle. Before he leaves, the Skeksis discover Jen is searching for the shard, not wanting
       him to succeed, the general sends the garthim, arachnid-like creaters, to capture him. As Jen travels, he comes across a canyon, which he is caght in due to living vines. While trapped, a women width
       one eye discovers him, shocked to see a gelfling. Discovering that she is Aughra, he asks for the crytsal shard on behalf of UrSu. Aughra releases him, leading him into her orrery, she then gives him
       a box of crystal shards, unsure which one is the right one. After much deliberation, Jen finds the right shard, only for the Garthim to break into Aughra's home, ruining the inside. Escaping, Jen watches on as the
       building burns. Despaired, Jen travels through the forest, only to come across another gelfling, called Kira, when they meet, Kira reveals that she was raised by podlings in the forest, and Jen tells her his
       background. She leads him back to the podling village where they rest and Jen tells her of his quest. After the garthim attacks the village and take some of the podlings, Kira joins Jen on his quest to get her
       people back. They take animals called "landstriders" to travel faster across the land. They arrive at the castle right as the garthim arrive, Jen distracts the garthim while Kira releases the podlings. After
       being cornered, Kira grabs Jen and flys down into the empty moat. When Jen asks why she has wings and he doesn't, she reveals that only girls have wings. They creep into the castle from the dungeon, only to be
       ambushed by the chamberlain, grabbing Kira and destroying the tunnel above Jen. When SkekSil brings the gelfling to the skeksis, they reinstate his position and take Kira to the scientist. SkekTek, the scientist
       then subjects Kira to the corrupted crystal, hoping to drain her essence so that the skeksis may live longer. She then calls out to the caged animals in the lab to help. Freeing themselves, they attack the
       scientist, causing him to fall the firery pit beneath the crystal. Jen escapes the tunnel and then arrives in the throne room about the same time as Kira, and see the crystal, knowing that they must reunite the
       shard with the main piece. After getting on top of the crystal, Kira is stabbed by SkekZok, the ritual-master; Jen, greif-striken, puts the shard back into the Crystal of Truth right as the Great Conjenction
       occurs, the castle begins to crumble around them, much to the skeksis panic. As they run around, the urRu arrive after traveling from their home. The convergence then causes the skeksis and urRu merge into one
       entity called "urSkeks." They then explain that they were split apart when the crystal cracked, and now that they are whole, they may leave the planet. Before they go, they heal Kira, then turn into light and
       disapear. The movie ends with the castle, gleaming and the area around lush with life.</p>
